Cricket is a very popular sport played and watched by millions of fans around the world.
It is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams, each consisting of eleven players.
The game is played on a circular field with a rectangular 22-yard-long pitch in the center.
The primary objective is for the batting team to score runs by hitting the ball and running between two sets of wickets.
The fielding team aims to dismiss the batsmen or restrict the runs scored.
Cricket has different formats, including Test matches, One Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 (T20) matches.
The sport has a rich history, with international competitions like the ICC Cricket World Cup and the Ashes series being highly prestigious.
Legendary players like Sachin Tendulkar, Sir Donald Bradman, and Brian Lara have left a significant impact on the game.
Cricket has a diverse fan base, and major cricketing nations include India, Australia, England, Pakistan, and South Africa.
The game's unique terminology, such as "bowled," "lbw" (leg before wicket), and "century," adds to its charm and complexity.
